#holdem-rs

An implementation of a [poker hand evaluator](http://suffecool.net/poker/evaluator.html) by Kevin Suffecool (aka Cactus Kev) with optimizations based on Paul D. Senzee's [Optimized Hand Evaluator](http://www.paulsenzee.com/2006/06/some-perfect-hash.html) in Rust.

The crate is called `pokereval` and you can depend on it via cargo:

```ini

git = "https://github.com/th4t/pokereval-rs.git"
```
