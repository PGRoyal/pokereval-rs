#pokereval-rs

A Rust library, implementating a poker hand evaluator. Based on [the original work](http://suffecool.net/poker/evaluator.html) of by Kevin Suffecool (aka Cactus Kev) and the optimizations later contributed by Paul D. Senzee's in his [Optimized Hand Evaluator](http://www.paulsenzee.com/2006/06/some-perfect-hash.html).

The crate is called `pokereval` and you can depend on it via cargo:

```ini

git = "https://github.com/th4t/pokereval-rs.git"
```
